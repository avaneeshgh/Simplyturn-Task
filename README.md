Have created an angular app with two main components and a service

1. main-nav component
   --responsible for displaying navigation links if required and is also responsive.

2. viewdata component
   --responsible for displaying data in table format after getting data from API

3. TabledataService
   --responsible for getting data from API using http get call and retyurns promise to the caller method for subscription.

-- Have used PrimeNg component Libraries like InputTextModule,TableModule for catchy UI and smooth design and excellent inbuilt features.
